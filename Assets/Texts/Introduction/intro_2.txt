Request Methods
Having dealt with the basics of the API, let's go a little further, namely, let's deal with Request Methods, using which we can communicate with the API.

Without getting into too much detail, Request Methods characterize what action we are going to take by referring to the API. In total, there are four main types of actions:

GET: requests data from a server. This is the most common type of request. Using it we can get the data we are interested in from those that the API is ready to share.
POST: adds new data to the server. Using this type of request, you can, for example, add a new contact to CRM.
PUT: changes existing information. For example, using this type of request, it would be possible to change the color or value of an existing product.
DELETE: deletes existing information
